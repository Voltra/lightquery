## What is Lightquery

Lightquery is a library that tends to follow the mindset, patterns and philosophy behind jQuery
and propose a lighter alternative to it.

Just like jQuery it is mainly designed around DOM manipulations but also gives a lot of tools for other aspects of JavaScript.

## Why Lightquery?

### The name

The name is, let's be honest, not that original and has been used many many times. This library tends to be the one
that is truly lighter than jQuery : as light as a feather on your workflow.

### The use

You should consider using Lightquery (over jQuery) because it tends to be lighter, easier to use and has several sets of
protection which can be really handy when trying to understand what goes wrong in your code.

## How to use?

* Via npm/yarn : `npm i -S light_query`
* Via a CDN (e.g. [via jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/light_query))
* Downloading it from [github](https://github.com/Voltra/lightquery/releases) and including it in the DOM
